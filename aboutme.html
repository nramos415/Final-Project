      <h1> About Me</h1>
      </center>
        <p> My name is Nelson Ramos and I am currently an upcoming back end engineer programmer.
        I was born and raised in San Francisco. I love the diversity of the city and the culture. The only
         few things that the city should work on is helping the low income people. They are who help the culture of
        the city. I love sports because it another way to bring a community. Cars is another thing I love because it's another way
      that a community is built on passion like coding. I'm a very laid back person but if I find something I love, I get a passion and a drive to
      succed or overcome any obstacle to get to my goal.
      </p>

        <h1>Goals and Dreams</h1>
      </center>
      <p> Like all people I have dreams and goals. Some of those goals and dreams is like any one else is to make money
        to like comfortably in San Francisco. Also having luxrious cars and having a lifestyle that helps me travel and explore the
        world. Ultimately my end goal is to help everyone around me once I make also make their dreams come true. I believe
        first I must achieve my goals in order to have a better understanding and influence on someone who is trying to make their
        dreams come true. Like the Success Center I wanna be able to help young people make their dreams a reality. It is hard
        in today's economy to have the support but I wanna be a door to help them achieve their goals. So my main goal is to succed
        in life and help others also succed in life. Success Center gave me the opportunity and I also wanna give the opportunity back.
