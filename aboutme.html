      <h1> About Me</h1>
      </center>
        <p> My name is Nelson Ramos and I am currently an upcoming back end engineer programmer.
        My ultimate goal is to be a full stack engineer. I'm not gonna lie but how much money
        a developer can make really intrigued me. It is one part on why I wanted to become a developer.
        The other side of it was I was amazed on how apps and website are created. I personally already have
         some websites and dreams that I wanna create in order to create my portfolio. I wanna be able to help and support my family while having fun
        I've also had so much help and amazing classmates and teachers helping me on my journey.
        At the end of all this as soon I'm close to be able to buy 12 cars and 12 house, I wanna help
        be able to fund and help create a path to be successful.</p>

        <h1>Goals and Dreams</h1>
      </center>
      <p>  Some of my dreams is making money while helping others. the ultimate goal
            is to be able to live more than comfortably while having fun. I wanna be able to buy
            cars without having to finance them. I wanna be able to buy property while having a
            good stack and give to others to help. I also when I get to this point be able to create
            classes and help people who are struggling up on their feet and learnhow to code.I would
            also like to help young people make money doing what they love like the success center.I believe
            if I can get the help to be successful than it is only right for me to give back.
