      <h1> About Me</h1>
      </center>
        <p> My name is Nelson Ramos and I am currently an upcoming back end engineer programmer.
        I was born and raised in San Francisco. I love the diversity of the city and the culture. The only
         few things that the city should work on is helping the low income people. They are who help the culture of
        the city. I love sports because it another way to bring a community. Cars is another thing I love because it's another way
      that a community that has a passion. I'm a very laid back person but is i find something I love I get a passion and a drive.</p>

        <h1>Goals and Dreams</h1>
      </center>
      <p>  Some of my dreams is making money while helping others. the ultimate goal
            is to be able to live more than comfortably while having fun. I wanna be able to buy
            cars without having to finance them. I want to be able to buy property while having a
            good stack and give to others to help. I also when I get to this point be able to create
            classes and help people who are struggling up on their feet and learn how to code.I would
            also like to help young people make money doing what they love like the success center.I believe
            if I can get the help to be successful than it is only right for me to give back.
